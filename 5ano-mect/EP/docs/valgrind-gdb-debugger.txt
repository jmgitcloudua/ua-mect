Valgrind

To check for memory leaks in a program called "program":
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full ./program

To track down an invalid read or write error:
valgrind --tool=memcheck ./program

To profile a program and find hotspots:
valgrind --tool=callgrind ./program

To debug hard to find race conditions between threads:
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./program

To detect leaks and errors in dynamically loaded libraries:
valgrind --trace-children=yes ./program

gdb

Run gdb on a program:
gdb ./program

Set a breakpoint at main:
b main

Run the program inside gdb:
run

Print a variable value:
print variable_name

Step through code line-by-line:
next

Continue execution:
continue

Examine stack trace:
bt

Examine memory:
x/16xb memory_address
